# OrbeatSongbook

OrbeatSongbook is a personal project designed for musicians. It allows multiple users on the same network to share the name of Song sheet (PDF format) they are currently displaying and to navigate others to the sheet with the same name stored on their respective devices (the actual contents of the files may, of course vary, since different instruments require different sheets). 

The PDF files should be all stored in a folder named "Orbeat Songbook" in the device`s outermost storage directory. From there, the App retrieves the files upon launch and if opened within the App, a broadcast is sent to all devices on the same network and all running Orbeat Songbook instances will attempt to open a file with corresponding name. 

Users are also encouraged to create Setlists in order to use the App in the most comfortable way.
